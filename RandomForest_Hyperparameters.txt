# RandomForest_Hyperparameters

1. max_depth;
the maximum depth of the tree-meaning the longest path between the root node and the leaf node

2. min_sample_split;
The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node
where the default = 2

3. max_leaf_nodes;
This is the maximum number of leaf nodes a decision tree can have

4. min_sample_leaf;
This is the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node 
where the default = 1 

5. n_estimators;
This is the number of trees in the RandomForest_Hyperparameters

6. max_sample;
This determines the fraction of the original dataset that is given to any individual tree

7. max_features;
This is the number of features to condider when looking for the best split.

8. bootstrap;
If this is set as False, the whole dataset is used to build each tree, but it is set as default

9. criterion;
The function to measure the quality of a split
